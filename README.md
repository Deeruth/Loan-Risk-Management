# Loan Risk Management

## Project_Overview
---
Daiz Bank is a Loan financing bank.  Its challenge revolves around the management of their vast and diverse loan portfolio—a portfolio that has been the cornerstone of the bank's success.
Conducting a risk analysis can help the bank determine whether they should approve a loan or financial application, and what actions they may need to take to protect their interests.
This type of analysis facilitates a balance between risks and risk reduction. By delving deep into the data, Daiz Bank can identify underserved markets, customer segments with growth potential, and innovative lending products.
